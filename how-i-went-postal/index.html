<p>A bit more than a year ago, during an evening out with friends at the local pub, we were talking about how social media changed our relationships and if it was for the best. </p><p>Opinions were split: some people felt it was great to be able to stay in touch and be aware about the whereabouts of ex-friends in other countries, and some regretted they didn't have much to say to people when they met up, because they knew everything, so there was nothing to catch up on. </p><p>Right then, I realised that I spent - probably like most of you if you read this post - more time online to catch-up with friends than over the phone or physically meeting up with them... and it got me thinking. I realised I had lost a big part of what I enjoyed doing: writing. </p><p>When I was younger (when email wasn't a thing, really) I used to send letters to my friends, who replied. We did this mainly when we were on holidays, but also within school terms. Letters were a way to communicate safely, away from parental ears (in those days, we didn't have mobile phone either), deep considered messages. </p><p>As a teenager, it was nice to spend some time thinking about what and how you'd express your true feelings to a best friend, or a secret love. It was also very scary to decide to *send* the letter, and wait for a potential reply. Will they think I'm mad? Did they find the letter nice? Was I as funny as I hoped? Was I ridicule? Will they laugh at me? <br>But then, what a joy and excitement to receive something back, a few days later?  </p><p>I reckon those were very formative years. It forced me to think a bit more carefully, and really crafting nice words and experiences to my letters. I was trying to make them special, so that people saw the care and attention I put into them. It was real communication, not just small talk. I've since tried to write a bit more online, but it's not the same thing: you can't draw, or change the shape of letters the same way. There is a dimension missing. </p><p>As a matter of fact, not so long ago, a friend told me they still had a letter I sent them 20 years ago, because it was nicely crafted. </p><p>And now, what? I didn't write anymore, and the only letters I receive are bills, bank statements or adverts. Nothing special. I receive more paper now than ever, but I sometimes spend a couple of week without opening them. They're boring. Nothing worth while. </p><p>Back in that pub, I ask my friends when was the last time they received a handwritten letter. For all of them is was YEARS (if you don't count Xmas cards). I asked them how they'd feel if they received something out of the blue. They told me they'd be surprised, but probably would receive it positively: everyone likes a little something different to change of the daily routine. </p><p>This is when, last year, I decided to run an experiment. I decided to write letters to strangers, and send them an envelope too, in case they wanted to reply.  My belief is that I would get around 10% of reply back. An higher average than traditional commercial mailing campaign. </p><p>Now I've been going on for a while, and talked about it, people have convinced me I should do something with the story, "at least write a blog about it!". So here I am. Welcome to my journey, and discover how I went postal. </p></div></section></div><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-black colors-local " data-reactid="15"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="16"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="17"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="18"><span data-reactid="19"><!-- react-empty: 20 --><h2 data-reactid="21"><a data-reactid="22">Going Postal</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="24"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="25"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="26"></div></section></div></div>
