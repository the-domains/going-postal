I need a system

Here I am. I've created a few letters now, and some people replied. Now, I realise I need a system, if I want to know who is replying to what (in case they do reply). 

I'm keeping a record of the letter I sent (I'm scanning them before they go) and I keep a record of the address I sent it to. Now, if someone reply, they're unlikely to let me know their name and address... so the only way I can link an eventual reply and the original letter is to mark the return envelope, somehow...So I've decided to write the number of the letter inside the envelope I'm sending with my original letter. 

This way, I'll be able to see when people reply, as well as if they reply.
